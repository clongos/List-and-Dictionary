1. Lists cannot store value in every element but dictionaries can.
2. It depends on how our program will work, but when it comes to uses, dictionaries stands out. :D
3. - we can easily manipulate the elements in lists by the use of indeces
   - we can assign value to each element in dictionaries
4. 16
5. dictionary ={'name':'Chris','age':20}
	for key in dictionary:
    		print key
6. dictionary ={'name':'Chris','age':20}
	for key in dictionary:
    		print dictionary[key]
7. lists = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
   lists.remove(lists[-1])
   print lists
8. list_1 = [1,2,3]
   list_2 = [1,2,4]
   if list_1 == list_2:
       print True
   else:
       print False
9. lists = [7,8,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6]
   print set(lists)
10. DICT AND LIST COMPREHENSIONS are used to create list through for loop and an if condition. Through this we can create a list that has an arithmetic pattern based on our range and condition. It can also help shorten our codes.
